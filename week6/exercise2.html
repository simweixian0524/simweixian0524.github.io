            <h1>Etymology</h1>
            The word jungle originates from the Sanskrit word jaṅgala (Sanskrit: जङ्गल), meaning rough and arid. It came
            into the English language via Hindi in the 18th century.] Jāṅgala has also been variously transcribed in
            English as jangal, jangla, jungal, and juṅgala.[citation needed] Although the Sanskrit word refers to dry
            land, it has been suggested that an Anglo-Indian interpretation led to its connotation as a dense "tangled
            thicket", while others have argued that a cognate word in Urdu derived from Persian, جنگل (Jangal), did
            refer to forests. The term is prevalent in many languages of the Indian subcontinent, and the Iranian
            Plateau, where it is commonly used to refer to the plant growth replacing primeval forest or to the unkempt
            tropical vegetation that takes over abandoned areas.

            <h1>History</h1>
            The jungle is the richest habitat on Earth. Over the intervals of time, different parts of tropical areas
            have provided a variety of flora and fauna, together with newer species discovered annually. Tropical
            jungles have been the home to indigenous peoples, who have shaped traditional cultures and civilizations
            based on the environment.

            <h1>Wildlife</h1>
            Because jungles occur on all inhabited landmasses and may incorporate numerous vegetation and land types in
            different climatic zones, the wildlife of jungles cannot be straightforwardly defined.
